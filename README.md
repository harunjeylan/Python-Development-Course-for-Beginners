Here is a course syllabus for a beginner Python development course:

# Python Development Course for Beginners

This course will provide a solid foundation in Python programming for complete beginners. Students will learn basic programming concepts, Python syntax, data types, variables, conditional logic, loops, functions, and more. By the end of the course, students will have the skills to build simple Python programs and scripts.

## Week 1 - Introduction to Python

- Setting up a Python development environment
- Running Python code in the interpreter 
- Basic Python syntax
- Comments, variables, data types
- Working with strings, numbers, booleans
- User input and output 
- Conditional logic (if, else, elif)

## Week 2 - Python Types and Operations

- Lists, tuples, dictionaries
- Accessing, updating, deleting elements
- List slicing, merging, sorting
- Dictionaries and looping
- Comparison and logical operators
- Introducing functions

## Week 3 - Control Flow in Python

- for and while loops
- break, continue, pass
- range() function
- iterators and generators
- zip and enumerate
- List and dict comprehensions
- Functions to control flow like map, filter, reduce

## Week 4 - Functions in Python

- Defining functions
- Arguments and parameters 
- Scope and namespace
- Return values
- *args and **kwargs
- Recursive functions
- Lambda functions
- Built-in functions
- Functional programming concepts

## Week 5 - Modules and Packages

- Importing modules and packages
- Creating modules and packages
- Namespaces
- __main__ check
- Popular standard library modules (os, sys, math, etc)
- Third party packages and virtual environments

## Week 6 - Files and Exception Handling 

- Reading and writing files
- File modes, buffers, and context managers
- Working with file paths
- Reading and writing CSVs
- Handling exceptions
- try, except, else, finally
- Raising exceptions
- Built-in exceptions

## Week 7 - Classes and Objects

- Creating and using classes
- Constructors, instance variables, methods
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Magic methods like __init__, __str__ etc
- Python class attributes like __dict__
- Using Python standard library classes

## Week 8 - Final Project

- Use your Python skills to build a simple command line application, script, web scraper, or other program to demonstrate your learning
- Practice coding style, documentation, testing, and packaging skills
- Get feedback from instructor and classmates

By the end of this course, students will have a solid grasp on Python programming fundamentals and skills to build their own Python programs and scripts. The final project gives them a chance to apply their knowledge to implement their own program idea.
