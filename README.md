# Python Development Course for Beginners 

## Week 1 - Introduction to Python
**Course Overview:** This week provides an introduction to Python programming. Students will learn how to set up a Python development environment, work with basic Python syntax, data types, variables, input/output operations, and simple conditional logic.

**Examples:**

- Hello World program

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

- Commenting code

```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello") # This prints Hello
```

- Variables for strings, integers, floats

```python 
name = "John"
age = 25 
gpa = 3.95
```

- Print statements

```python
print("Your name is", name)
print("You are", age, "years old") 
```

- Getting user input with input()

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello", name)
```

- if/else statements

```python
age = 20
if age >= 18:
  print("You are an adult")
else:
  print("You are not an adult")
```

- Simple math operations

```python
x = 10 + 3
y = 20 - 5
z = x * y
```

## Week 2 - Python Types and Operations

**Course Overview:** This week delves deeper into Python's core data structures like lists, tuples, and dictionaries. Students will learn how to access, modify, and manipulate elements within these structures. They will also learn about Python comparison, logical, and identity operators.

**Examples:**

- Creating lists, tuples, dicts

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"] #list
colors = ("red", "blue", "green") #tuple
user = {
  "name": "John",
  "age": 20  
} #dict
```

- List indexing and slicing  

```python
first = fruits[0] 
last = fruits[-1]
sublist = fruits[1:3] 
```

- Adding and removing dict elements

```python
user["email"] = "john@example.com" # Add key-value
del user["age"] # Remove key-value pair
```

- Sorting lists

```python 
fruits.sort() # In-place sort
sorted_fruits = sorted(fruits) # New sorted list
```

- Simple list/dict comprehensions

```python
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
evens = [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
```

- Using logical operators like and/or

```python
age = 25
is_adult = (age >= 18) and (age <= 65) 
```

- Comparing values with ==, >, < etc.

```python
x = 10
y = 20
x > y # False 
x < y # True
x == 10 # True
```

## Week 3 - Control Flow in Python

**Course Overview:** This week covers control flow concepts like loops and conditionals in Python. Students will learn how to use for/while loops, break/continue statements, iterators, generators, and functions like range(), map(), filter(), etc.

**Examples:**

- for loops to iterate through lists

```python
for fruit in fruits:
  print(fruit)
```

- while loops with break/continue

```python
i = 0
while i < 5:
  print(i)
  i += 1
  if i == 3:
    break # Exit loop
```

- Writing simple generators with yield 

```python
def counter():
  i = 0
  while True:
    yield i
    i += 1
```

- Using range() to generate numbers

```python
for i in range(5):
  print(i) # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
```

- Creating lists with list comprehensions

```python  
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
```

- Filtering lists using filter()

```python
evens = filter(lambda x: x%2 == 0, range(10)) 
```

## Week 4 - Functions in Python

**Course Overview:** This week provides a deeper look at functions in Python. Students will learn how to define and call functions with parameters and arguments. Important concepts like scope, return values, and lambdas will be covered.

**Examples:**

- Defining functions with parameters

```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```

- Returning values from functions

```python
def multiply(x, y):
  return x * y

z = multiply(2, 3) # z = 6
```

- Variable scope within functions

```python
def f():
  x = 10 # Local variable
  print(x)

x = 5 # Global variable 
f() # Prints 10
```

- Using return values in expressions

```python
def add(x, y):
  return x + y

z = (add(2, 3) * 5) # z = 25
```

- Passing functions as args to other functions

```python
def operate(func, x, y):
  return func(x, y)

def add(x, y):
  return x + y

operate(add, 2, 3) # Returns 5
```  

- Writing and using lambda functions

```python
multiply = lambda x, y: x * y
print(multiply(2, 3)) # Prints 6
```

## Week 5 - Modules and Packages 

**Course Overview:** This week introduces modules and packages in Python. Students will learn how to import modules, create new modules/packages, and use virtual environments for dependency management.

**Examples:**

- Importing math, random, and other modules

```python
import math
import random
```

- Creating new modules and importing into other files

```python
# mymodule.py
def add(x, y):
  return x + y

# main.py
import mymodule
mymodule.add(2, 3) 
```

- Importing specific functions from modules  

```python
from math import sin, cos 
print(sin(0))
```

- Managing dependencies with virtual environments

```bash
# Create virtual env 
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual env
source venv/bin/activate

# Install packages
pip install numpy
```

- Using __name__ and __main__ code checks

```python 
if __name__ == "__main__":
  print("Running main program")
```

## Week 6 - Files and Exception Handling

**Course Overview:** This week covers working with files and handling exceptions in Python. Students will learn how to open, read, and write files. They will also learn how to handle errors and exceptions gracefully with try/except blocks.

**Examples:**

- Opening/closing files with with statement

```python
with open("file.txt") as f:
  data = f.read()
```  

- Writing to files with write(), readline() 

```python
with open("file.txt", "w") as f:
  f.write("Hello world!") 

with open("file.txt", "r") as f:
  print(f.readline())
```

- Appending vs overwriting files

```python
# Append
with open("file.txt", "a") as f:
  f.write("Appended text")

# Overwrite
with open("file.txt", "w") as f:
  f.write("Overwritten text") 
```

- Using CSV reader/writer for CSV files

```python
import csv

with open("data.csv") as f:
  reader = csv.reader(f)
  for row in reader:
    print(row)

with open("data.csv", "w") as f:
  writer = csv.writer(f)
  writer.writerow(["Column1", "Column2"]) 
  writer.writerow(["Value1", "Value2"])
```

- Catching exceptions with try/except blocks

```python
try:
  x = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
  print("Cannot divide by zero")
```  

- Handling different exception types

```python 
try:
  int("abc") 
except ValueError:
  print("Cannot convert string to int")
```

## Week 7 - Classes and Objects

**Course Overview:** This week introduces object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like classes and objects. Students will learn how to define classes with attributes and methods. Important OOP principles like inheritance and polymorphism will be covered.

**Examples:**

- Defining simple classes and creating instances

```python
class Person:
  pass

p = Person()
```

- Initializing objects with the __init__ method

```python
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p = Person("John", 25)
```

- Using class attributes and methods

```python
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
  
  def greet(self):
    print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name}")

p = Person("John", 25)
p.greet()
```

- Inheritance to extend class functionality

```python
class Vehicle:
  def description(self):
    print(f"A vehicle with {self.wheels} wheels")

class Car(Vehicle):
  wheels = 4

c = Car()
c.description() # "A vehicle with 4 wheels"
```

- Polymorphism with method overriding

```python
class Animal:
  def make_sound(self):
    print("Some sound")

class Dog(Animal):
  def make_sound(self):
    print("Bark") 

a = Animal()
a.make_sound() # Some sound
d = Dog()
d.make_sound() # Bark
```

## Week 8 - Final Project

For the final project, students will build an application that demonstrates their Python skills. Example projects could include:

- A command line application like a quiz game
- An automation script to process files or data
- A web scraper to extract data from websites
- A Python package with reusable modules and functions

The final project will solidify students' Python programming abilities through creating a functional program, applying coding style, testing, and documentation principles.
